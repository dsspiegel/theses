\begin{definition}
\label{liealg}
Given a set $\cA$ and a field $\cK$, $\cA$ is said to be a \emu{Lie algebra} over $\cK$ if it is closed under a product operation $[-,-]$ that satisfies properties \pns{i} through \pns{iv} of Theorem \ref{bracket}.  This product operation is referred to as the \emu{Lie bracket}.
\end{definition}
